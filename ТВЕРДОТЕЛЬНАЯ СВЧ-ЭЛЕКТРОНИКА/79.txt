Natural antagonistic microorganisms have emerged as a promising alternative 
to chemical interactions for more rational and safe crop management, so several 
strains belonging to the genus Bacillus and particularly to the B. subtilis and B. amy-
loliquefaciens species were reported effective for the bio control of multiple plant 
diseases caused by soil-borne [1] or post-harvest pathogens [2, 3, 4]. It is well known 
that some Bacillus species may synthesize numerous antimicrobial or, more general-
ly, bioactive compounds with well-established activity in vitro [5]. However, except 
for a very limited number of strains [6], many studies that relate the global potential 
for antibiotic production with the biocontrol activity of a particular Bacillus strain 
have been reported. But B. amyloliquefaciens strain SA94 displays high in vitro inhi-
bitory activity toward growth of multiple fungal and plant pathogens [7]. 
In this study we isolated 54 strains of B. amyloliquefaciens found on 21 apple 
shoots, all of these strains are morphologically characterized by performing Gram 
staining and Molecular characterization performed by 16S rRNA with sequences 
16S-27F:

quences (100% of similarity) and it was confirmed by MALDI-TOF as B. amyloli-
quefaciens(SA94). Cultivation and isolation of secondary metabolites was done after 
fresh bacterial colonies suspension transferring into Erlenmeyer flask (1L) was con-
taining 100 g rice for solid cultures. The cultures were then incubated at room tem-
perature without shaking for 21 days. Then complete extraction filtration was done 
followed by repeated extraction with EtOAc and MeOH. HPLC analysis of the bac-
terial crude extract was investigated.  
The isolated strain B. amyloliquefaciens(SA94), was tested in vitro to detection 
antagonistic activity against many of pathogenic fungi, the results showed that B. 
amyloliquefaciens recorded high antagonistic activity (fig. 1).

According to Sephadex fractions, the peaks of the HPLC- chromatogram were 
matched with the reference compound available in the database by UV-Visible spec-
trum. The peaks in the chromatogram having the same UV-Visible spectrum and reten-
tion time with that of the reference compound was identified and named. 1-Scalarolide, 
2-Cerebroside, 3-Palitantin all of these data are listed in (fig. 2) and (Table 1).

The bacterial crude extract was tested for cytotoxicity against the mouse lym-
phoma cell line L5178Y. (IC50>10 mg/mL), using the microculture tetrazolium 
(MTT) assay, as well as antibacterial potentials of the crude extract were evaluated 
against Staphyloccocus aureus ATCC 25922, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The 
results showed that B. amyloliquefaciens crude extract has antibacterial activity 
against S. aureus ATCC 25922, but not active against M. tuberculosis. Also bacterial 
crude extract showed weak cytotoxic activity against lymphoma cell line L5178Y,
