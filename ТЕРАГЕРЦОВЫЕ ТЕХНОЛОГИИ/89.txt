Introduction
The topic of terahertz technology has emerged
as a potential frontier with a wide variety of applications in today's fast evolving technological world. Between microwave and infrared
wavelengths, terahertz waves, often called T-rays,
generally have frequencies between 0.1 to 10 terahertz (THz) [1, 2]. This frequency range is ideal
for many applications because to its special benefits, which include non-ionizing radiation, excellent spatial resolution, and material penetration.
Due to its capacity to improve terahertz system
performance, Nanoantenna arrays have attracted
a lot of interest in the field of terahertz detection.
The exact control of electromagnetic waves at terahertz frequencies is made possible by these arrays [3], which are made up of subwavelengthsized antennas grouped in a regular manner. Nanoantenna arrays provide better sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution by taking advantage of
the collective behavior of nanoscale antennas, enabling groundbreaking developments in several
fields.
Basics of Terahertz Technology
The term “terahertz technology” refers to
the study and use of electromagnetic waves in
the 0.1–10 THz (1 THz = 1012 Hz) frequency range [3]. This frequency band is in the middle of the
microwave and infrared spectrum. Terahertz waves
have special characteristics that make them suited for
a variety of uses in several industries. Terahertz
waves stand apart from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum thanks to a number of features. First
off, terahertz vibrations are non-ionizing [4], which
means they lack the energy to ionize atoms or molecules. They are safe for a variety of uses, such as security screening and medical imaging, thanks to this
quality.
Terahertz waves may also penetrate a wide
range of materials, including biological tissues as
well as fabrics, plastics, paper, and ceramics [5].
This characteristic makes it possible to image
structures that are not easily accessible using other
types of radiation and to analyze items without
causing any damage to them. Below Fig. 1 shows
the placement of the THz wave in the spectrum.

ver of THz radiations. In the THz radiation is
therefore capable of detecting differences in tissue
water content and density [9]. Terahertz imaging,
for instance, can also be used in the pharmaceutical
sector to characterize tablet material or in the restoration of fine art to analyze hidden layers in paintings [10].
2. Communication. Because of its enormous
bandwidth, terahertz waves have the potential
to enable high-speed wireless communication systems [11]. The data rate of existing wireless system typically of 100 Mbps, is limited by the use
of carrier wave below 5 GHz. High data rates are
made possible by higher frequency carriers,
and terahertz carrier waves enable data speeds
of up to 1000 Gbps [12]. The benefit of terahertz
communication is that it is immune to interference
from other wireless technologies that use lower
frequencies.
3. Spectroscopy. Terahertz spectroscopy enables the examination of atomic and molecular
vibrations, revealing details about the structure and
chemical make-up of materials. Environmental
monitoring, security [13], and pharmaceutical
research all benefit greatly from this.
4. Characterization of Materials. Semiconductors, superconductors, and other sophisticated
materials may be characterized by using terahertz
radiation to examine the electronic, vibrational,
and magnetic characteristics of the materials [14].
5. Security and Surveillance. Terahertz waves
may be applied to security screening tasks including finding narcotics, explosives, or concealed
weapons. By detecting variations in terahertz wave
transmission and reflection via various materials,
terahertz imaging devices may locate items that are
concealed [14]. Using terahertz systems, one can
simultaneously perform imaging & spectroscopy.
It has been shown that terahertz waves can penetrate materials such as paper, wood, plastic, ceramic etc. This allows them to reveal the presence
of objects. There are several potential applications
for this technology including identification of
liquids in suspicious bottles, explosives in a mail
envelope, detection of drugs.
6. Dental Cleanliness. Dental carries frequently knows as tooth rot is perhaps of the most widely
recognized human problem. Carry on by delivering
a subsurface sore in the veneer. If there is no macroscopically visible disintegration or even the formation of micro cavities at the toothe surface, the
disease may spread to the dentine, the next tissue
in the tooth layer. It is difficult to catch dental
decay early because there are no obvious signs on
the both surface. X ray one of the well-known
methods for detecting decay, only reveal the issue
when drilling and filling are the only options for
preventing degradation.
Below Fig. 5 shows the applications of THz
application fields.
Designing effective and dependable systems
requires a thorough understanding of the principles
of terahertz technology. We shall examine the nanoantenna arrays especially suited for terahertz
detection in the further section of this paper. We
are able to find answers to a variety of problems
in industries ranging from telecommunications to
healthcare by utilizing the special characteristics
of terahertz waves.
Introduction to Nanoantennas
In the realm of terahertz technology, nanoantennas are crucial, especially for the detection and
control of terahertz waves. The diameters of these
nanoscale-engineered antennas are often smaller
than the wavelengths of the electromagnetic waves
with which they interact. A wide range of applications in terahertz devices and systems are made
possible by nanoantennas' efficient ability to link,
emit, and modify terahertz radiation [15]. Enhancing the interaction between electromagnetic
waves and materials at terahertz frequencies is the
main goal of nanoantennas. The optical and electrical characteristics of the Nano antennas may be
precisely adjusted to accomplish desired functionality by modifying their size, shape, and material
composition. Nanoantennas allow for the targeted
sensing and manipulation of terahertz waves by
concentrating them into subwavelength zones,
increasing the field intensity [16]. Several types
of nanoantennas are commonly used in terahertz
applications:
1. Dipole Antennas. Dipole antennas are made
up of two conducting components, which are often
shaped like straight rods or arms [17, 18] shown in
Fig. 6. They are frequently used in terahertz technology because of how easy they are to make.
Depending on the intended use, dipole antennas
can be built as resonant or non-resonant structures.

2. Loop Antennas. A conductive loop or coil,
which may have a circular, rectangular, or other
shape, makes up a loop antenna [19] in Fig. 7.
In terahertz systems that need a reduced footprint,
loop antennas are frequently employed because of
their tiny size. They have a high radiation efficiency and are capable of resonant behavior. Fig. 6. Dipole antenna

3. Patch Antennas. These planar devices,
which are generally made of a metallic patch and
a dielectric substrate, operate as antennas [20, 21]
shown in Fig. 8. Due to their simplicity of integration, compatibility with microfabrication methods,
and customizable resonant qualities, they are
commonly utilized in terahertz systems. Patch antennas are capable of achieving great radiation efficiency and directivity.
Fig. 8. Patch antenna
4. Spiral Antennas. Spiral antennas have conductive traces that are frequently etched or printed
in the shape of spirals on a substrate [22] illustrated in Fig. 9. Spiral antennas are suited for terahertz applications that need broad frequency
coverage and constrained physical area because of
their broadband performance and small size.
Fig. 9. Spiral antenna
Nanoimprinting, self-assembly processes, electron beam lithography, and other methods can all
be used to create nanoantennas. Usually, they are
constructed of metals like gold, silver, or copper,
which have outstanding optical and conductivity
qualities at terahertz frequencies. Nanoantennas
can also benefit from the use of dielectric and semiconductor materials to improve performance or
accomplish certain functionality [23].
In order to achieve the necessary electromagnetic
response, size, shape, material qualities, and nanow

antenna design must be carefully balanced [24].
To optimize the design parameters and forecast
the behavior of nanoantennas, a variety of simulation tools are used, such as the finite element
method (FEM) or finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) approaches.
The design considerations, manufacturing processes, and performance assessment of nanoantenna
arrays especially suited for terahertz detection will
be covered in the following chapters. We can improve the sensitivity, resolution [24], and selectivity
of terahertz systems by utilizing the special qualities
of nanoantennas, opening the door to groundbreaking
applications in fields including security, medical
imaging, and non-destructive testing.
Terahertz Detection Techniques
For recording and analyzing terahertz waves in
a variety of applications, terahertz detection methods are crucial. These methods make it possible
to measure, image, and characterize terahertz
radiation, giving vital information about the characteristics of materials and paving the way for
the creation of terahertz-based gadgets and systems. There are several detecting methods used,
and each has a special benefit and application.
Short terahertz wave pulses are sent and received via time-domain methods. These pulses interact with the target substance or item, which reveals details about its qualities. There are two popular time-domain methods:
In THz-TDS, a brief terahertz pulse is generated, and when it interacts with the sample, its timedomain waveform is measured. The terahertz absorption, refractive index, and other physical characteristics of the material may be ascertained by
examining the amplitude and phase of the reflected
or transmitted waveform. THz-TDS is frequently
used in material characterization, pharmaceutical
analysis, and quality control since it enables
broadband measurements [25].
Electronic excitations in semiconductors have
previously tracked application in lasers, electronics
parts and PCs. At the same time, they comprise an
astonishing body framework whose quantum properties might be changed for instance by nanostructure
plan. Thus, THz spectroscopy on semiconductors is
not only use for uncovering new mechanical possibilities of nanostructures but also use as key properties
to control framework. Many peculiarities have previously been inspected utilizing brief THz beats.
The complicated permittivity or THz-retention coefficient and refractive list of unexcited, inborn semiconductors might be determined. Thz photons are
consumed fundamentally by free transporters in
doped or optically animated semiconductors.
TPI scans an object or sample using a terahertz
pulse. A two-dimensional or three-dimensional
picture of the target is produced using the measured reflected or transmitted pulses at various locations. TPI is used in applications for medical
imaging [26], non-destructive testing, and security
screening. The system is comprised of a laserdriven emitter, a beam-forming optics consisting
of focused optics and mirrors, a sample holder, and
an optical delay line, together with a laser-driven
detector [27]. Terahertz pulse (THz) is measured
with and without the sample using the difference
absorption spectra approach. The sample's dispersion and absorption, as determined by the Fourier
transformation. The phase and amplitude are both
determined by Terahertz – Time domain spectra
(THz-TDS). Fig. 10 depicts schematics diagram of
Terahertz time domain Spectroscopy. Fig. 11 depicts schematic representation of terahertz time
domain scanning and spectroscopic.

Terahertz Pulsed Imaging is a pharmacological
assessment device that uses very low power, extremely brief pulses of electrical energy at frequencies lower than ultraviolet (1 THz = 1012 Hz).
It is completely risk free and harmless. It has already been demonstrated that terahertz spectroscopy is useful for distinguishing among the medications various polymorph structures. TIP is the subsequent stage in this cycle, where THz beats are
utilized to picture an objective.
Lighting photoconductive semiconductors with
beat close infrared laser energy creates and distinguishes THz beats in a cognizant way. Tablet coatings are cloudy to THz frequencies and do not
disperse them altogether.
The behavior of materials or objects to terahertz radiation at certain frequencies is examined
using frequency-domain methods. These methods
frequently use continuous wave terahertz sources
to determine the amplitude and phase of the terahertz signal. The two primary frequency-domain
approaches are as follows:
1. Continuous Wave Terahertz Spectroscopy
(CW-TDS);
2. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR).
The limitations of conventional terahertz detectors and the particular benefits offered by nanoantenna-based systems led to the usage of nanoantenna arrays for terahertz detection. Nanoantenna
arrays are perfect for terahertz applications because
they provide high sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution. The purpose of employing nanoantenna arrays in terahertz technology is examined in
this paper. Conventional terahertz detectors including bolometers, photoconductive devices, and
Schottky diodes have been extensively used for
terahertz sensing and imaging [29]. The sensitivity,
bandwidth, and integration capabilities of these
detectors, however, are typically constrained. Here
are a few important limitations:
1. Low Sensitivity. Conventional terahertz detectors frequently have low sensitivity, requiring
the utilization of high-power terahertz sources or
sophisticated amplification systems to generate
adequate signal levels. This reduces the entire system's detecting range and sensitivity.
2. Narrow Bandwidth. Because many traditional detectors have restricted bandwidth, it is difficult to catch a wide variety of terahertz frequencies at the same time [30]. This can stymie applications requiring broad frequency coverage or
spectroscopic research.
3. Big and Elaborate Designs. Because certain
traditional detectors require elaborate cooling
systems or external optics, they are big, costly, and
difficult to integrate into small devices. This restricts their use in portable or tiny terahertz devices. Nanoantenna arrays outperform traditional
terahertz detectors in various ways, solving the
constraints outlined above and enabling substantial
advances in terahertz technology:
1. Increased Sensitivity. Nanoantenna arrays
may focus terahertz waves into subwavelength areas, significantly increasing local field strength.
This higher field strength enhances terahertz detection sensitivity, allowing for the identification of
weak signals and increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio [31].
2. Wideband Operation. Nanoantenna arrays
may span a wide frequency range by creating
nanoantennas with specific resonant qualities. This
enables the detection and manipulation of numerous terahertz frequencies at the same time, ena-

bling broadband terahertz systems and spectroscopic investigation [32].
3. Improved Spatial Resolution. Nanoantenna
arrays increase spatial resolution by confining terahertz waves into subwavelength areas [32]. This
allows for high-resolution imaging and sensing,
as well as the identification of small-scale features
and the exact localization of terahertz sources.
4. Compact and Integrable Designs. Nanoantennas are small and easy to integrate with other
components like microelectronic circuits or imaging systems. Because of their small size, nanoantennas may be easily integrated into portable or
miniature terahertz devices, broadening the variety
of conceivable applications [32].
The use of nanoantenna arrays in terahertz detection systems is a possible option for overcoming
the limits of traditional detectors and unleashing
new terahertz technological possibilities.
Design Considerations
for Nanoantenna Arrays
Nanoantenna arrays for terahertz detection
need careful consideration of numerous characteristics, materials, and production procedures. These
design factors are critical in influencing the performance and usefulness of nanoantenna arrays.
This section brings into light crucial elements to
consider throughout the design process.
When building nanoantenna arrays for terahertz
detection, several aspects must be considered:
1. Resonant Frequency. The nanoantennas
resonant frequency should match the intended terahertz frequency range of operation. The resonance frequency of nanoantennas may be controlled by adjusting their size, shape, and material
qualities. By matching the resonance frequency,
the incident terahertz waves may be efficiently
coupled to the nanoantennas.
2. Polarization. Nanoantennas with specified
polarization properties, such as linear, circular,
or elliptical polarization, can be created. The polarization to be used is determined by the application
requirements and the polarization state of the
terahertz waves to be detected.
3. Radiation Pattern. The directionality and
efficiency of the produced or received terahertz
waves are determined by the radiation pattern
of the nanoantenna arrays. Optimizing the radiation pattern ensures that terahertz signals are sent
or received in the desired direction.
4. Bandwidth. The frequency range across
which the nanoantenna arrays can efficiently couple with terahertz waves is defined by their bandwidth. Broadband nanoantenna designs are critical
for applications requiring broad frequency coverage or spectroscopic analysis.
The materials used in nanoantennas are critical
for obtaining high-performance terahertz detection:
1. Metals. Because of their outstanding conductivity and plasmonic features at terahertz frequencies, metals such as gold, silver, or copper are
widely employed for nanoantennas. Plasmonic
effects in metals can facilitate the interaction of
terahertz waves with nanoantennas, resulting in
higher sensitivity and field confinement [33].
2. Semiconductors. Certain semiconductor
materials, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) or indium phosphide (InP) [34], have advantageous terahertz detection capabilities. Semiconductors have
the capacity to give tunability and integration,
allowing for active control or modulation of terahertz signals.
3. Dielectrics. Dielectric materials, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) or polymers, are used as substrates for nanoantenna manufacturing because
of their low-loss qualities. Dielectrics can help
nanoantenna arrays with structural support, insulation, and thermal stability.
The materials used are determined by the required qualities, production procedures, and compatibility with other terahertz system components.
Fabrication processes are critical in achieving
nanoantenna arrays with exact dimensions and
high-quality structures:

итехника. Т. 23, № 2 (2024) Science and Technique. V. 23, No 2 (2024)
1. Electron Beam Lithography (EBL). EBL
is a high-resolution process that employs a concentrated electron beam to selectively expose a resist
material, enabling accurate patterning of nanoantennas. EBL is suited for fabricating nanoantenna arrays with subwavelength characteristics [35].
2. Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL). NIL includes mechanically pressing and heating a pattern
from a mold onto a substrate. NIL provides a lowcost, high-throughput method for producing nanoantenna arrays [36].
3. Self-Assembly Techniques. Self-assembly
methods use the intrinsic characteristics of materials to produce ordered nanostructures spontaneously. Depending on the individual requirements
and available resources, other manufacturing processes such as focused ion beam (FIB) milling,
photolithography, or nano-scale 3D printing may
be employed.
Nanoantenna array design for terahertz detection necessitates a thorough grasp of the necessary
parameters, material qualities, and manufacturing
procedures. Engineers and researchers may improve the performance and usefulness of nanoantenna arrays in terahertz applications by carefully examining these design elements.
Performance Metrics and Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of nanoantenna arrays for terahertz detection is crucial to ensure their
effectiveness and reliability. Several performance
metrics and evaluation techniques are utilized
to assess the functionality and efficiency of these
arrays. This section discusses key performance
metrics and evaluation methods commonly employed in the field. Key Performance Metrics for
Nanoantenna Arrays:
1. Radiation Efficiency. The capacity of nanoantenna arrays to convert incident terahertz waves into radiated power is measured by radiation
efficiency. It measures how well the arrays work
at sending or receiving terahertz radiation. Better
performance is indicated by a higher radiation efficiency. It can be expressed as:
  Pr Pi / ,
where η – is radiation efficiency; Pr is the radiated
power by the antenna; Pi is the input power to the
antenna.
2. Gain. Compared to an isotropic radiator,
gain is the amplification that the nanoantenna arrays produce when transmitting or receiving terahertz signals. It is computed as the difference
between the power emitted equally in all directions
and the power radiated in the intended direction.
Signal strength improves with higher gain. It can
be calculated using the equation:
G A (4 ) / 2,    
where G is the antenna gain; η is the radiation efficiency of the antenna; A is the effective aperture
area of the antenna; λ is the wavelength of the terahertz wave.
3. Bandwidth. The range of terahertz frequencies across which nanoantenna arrays demonstrate
effective coupling or radiation is referred to as
their bandwidth. Applications that need spectroscopic analysis or extensive frequency coverage
can be made possible by a greater bandwidth,
which makes it possible to capture a wider variety
of terahertz frequencies. The fractional bandwidth
(FBW) can be calculated using the equation:
max min 0 FBW f f f   ( )/ ,
where FBW is the fractional bandwidth; fmax is the
maximum frequency of operation; fmin is the minimum frequency of operation; f0 is the resonant frequency of the nanoantenna array.
4. Directivity. The capacity of nanoantenna
arrays to direct terahertz radiation in a particular
direction is measured by directivity. The ratio between the highest radiation intensity in the chosen
direction and the average radiation intensity in all
directions is used to calculate it. Better concentration ability is indicated by higher directivity.
The directivity (D) can be expressed as:
D   4 ( ), Prad Ptotal
where D is the directivity; Prad is the power radiated in the desired direction; Ptotal is the total
radiated power.
5. Polarization Features. Nanoantenna arrays
may display certain polarization features, such as
linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The arrays polarization properties need to coincide with
the polarization state of the terahertz waves. Essential variables to take into account are the level of
Informatics

и
polarization and the capacity to control polarization states.
Performance Evaluation through Simulation
and Measurement Methods. Using simulation
approaches, it is common practice to evaluate and
enhance the performance of nanoantenna arrays.
Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical
method for solving the partial differential equations governing the propagation of electromagnetic
waves. It allows for the modeling and simulation
of nanoantenna arrays, allowing for the examination of their electromagnetic characteristics and the
optimization of design parameters.
Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is a computer technique for solving Maxwell's equations that discretizes both space and
time. It is often used to investigate and simulate the
interactions between terahertz radiation and nanoantenna arrays. FDTD contributes to the usability
of nanoantenna arrays by showing how they behave in diverse settings. Measurement techniques
are essential for proving the viability of nanoantenna arrays.
Finite Element Method (FEM) is for figuring
out the amplitude and phase of terahertz waves that
interact with nanoantenna arrays is called terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) [37]. Investigations may evaluate the radiation efficacy, gain,
and frequency responsiveness of the arrays using
this technique.
Terahertz fields near nanoantenna arrays may be
observed and mapped with high resolution using
Near-Field Scanning Terahertz Microscopy (NSOM)
techniques. This enables the observation and characterization of the field distribution, directivity,
and polarization properties of the arrays. Engineers
and scientists may thoroughly assess the performance of nanoantenna arrays and improve their
designs to get the best functionality and efficiency
by combining modeling and measurement methodologies. These assessment techniques aid
in the verification of the theoretical models, direct
the process of design optimization, and speed up
the creation of high-performance terahertz detection systems.

The primary application areas where nanoantenna arrays have had a substantial influence are
explored in this section.
1. Security and Monitoring. Because they improve the capabilities for threat detection and identification, nanoantenna arrays have proven to be
beneficial in security and surveillance applications.
A few noteworthy uses are:
Terahertz radiation has the potential to penetrate clothing and other materials, making it feasible to discover unlawful or concealed goods.
Nanoantenna arrays make it simpler to find and
recognize hidden things because to their high sensitivity and spatial resolution.
Nanoantenna arrays may be used by terahertz
imaging systems to detect illegal substances that
are hidden in shipments or luggage. The enhanced
sensitivity and imaging capabilities of nanoantenna
arrays allow for more accurate detection and labeling of illicit products.
2. Diagnostic and Medical Imaging. The potential for medical imaging and diagnostics have
been broadened by non-invasive, high-resolution
nanoantenna arrays. Such uses in the healthcare
industry include:
Because malignant tissues absorb terahertz
energy differently than healthy cells, terahertz
waves may be able to distinguish between the two.
Nanoantenna arrays provide accurate imaging and
spectroscopic analysis, which help with the early
identification and characterization of malignancies.
Nanoantenna arrays in terahertz imaging devices can deliver accurate information on skin issues
including melanoma, burns, or infections. Highresolution imaging capabilities of nanoantenna arrays enable accurate skin disease diagnosis and
monitoring.
3. Nondestructive Testing and Quality Control. Nanoantenna arrays are crucial for nondestructive testing and quality control of materials
because they may reveal details about a material's
composition, structural integrity, and defects. Here
are a few examples:
 Material Characterization. Terahertz spectroscopy and nanoantenna arrays make it possible
to investigate the chemical, molecular, and bonding states of materials. This aids in the material's
characterization, quality assurance, and impurity or
pollutant identification.
 Defect Detection. Nanoantenna arrays used
in terahertz imaging systems may find flaws or
concealed damage in a variety of materials, such as
composites, ceramics, or electronic parts. They
enable the detection and visualization of structural
faults, such as fractures or delaminations, because
to their improved sensitivity and spatial resolution.
These application fields just scratch the surface of the numerous opportunities that nanoantenna arrays in terahertz technology afford.
Nanoantenna arrays are anticipated to find increasingly more varied uses as this field of study
and development advances, fostering developments in industries including telecommunications, environmental monitoring, and semiconductor characterization.
We shall dig more into the design concepts,
manufacturing methods, and particular application
concerns for nanoantenna arrays in terahertz detection in the subsequent sections of this paper.
